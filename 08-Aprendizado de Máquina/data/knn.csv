Ford Ka. While the Ford Ka is only available with a 1.2-litre petrol engine, Ford has gone into overdrive with its trim levels, and there are no less than seven: Studio, Studio Connect, Edge, Zetec, Titanium, Metal and Grand Prix III. You’ll need at least the Edge if you want air-con, while the top trims make the Ka look more stylish. It's still nowhere near as desirable as the Fiat 500, though, and the Skoda Citigo and Hyundai i10 are also more practical and better-equipped.;Ford
Ford Fiesta. With its modern looks and ability to offer big-car comfort in a compact, fun-to-drive package, is it any wonder that the Ford Fiesta is Britain's best-selling car? It holds on to its value as well as some more upmarket models like the Audi A1 and BMW 1 Series. It's available as a three or five-door, and the line-up is extensive, encompassing many different trims and a wide choice of engines, ranging from an impressive 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol to a 1.5-litre TDCi diesel. The ECOnetic diesels are the fuel-economy champions, while performance enthusiasts are catered for by the Ford Fiesta ST, which is one of our favourite sporty hatchbacks.;Ford
Ford B-MAX. The all-new Ford B-MAX is a practical five-seater hatchback based on the popular Ford Fiesta. Its unique selling point is a pair of sliding rear doors that do without central body pillars, offering much greater access to the rear cabin and luggage area. Ford's clever design provides the Ford B-MAX with a 1.5 metre wide opening on either side – compared to the Vauxhall Meriva's 0.7-metre opening.;Ford
Ford Focus. The Focus competes in one of most hotly contested classes in the market, going head-to-head with models such as the Volkswagen Golf, Vauxhall Astra and even more upmarket offerings such as the Audi A3 and BMW 1 Series. It's available as a five-door hatchback or estate, and a facelift in late 2014 improved styling, refinement, technology and emissions, helping it take the fight to the VW Golf more effectively than ever before. Thankfully, it remains great to drive.;Ford
Ford EcoSport. The Ford EcoSport is Ford's answer to the Nissan Juke and other cars in the small SUV market like the Renault Captur and Peugeot 2008. Based on the Ford Fiesta, the Ford EcoSport gets a raised driving position and SUV styling, but with car-like driving characteristics. Like the Ford Fiesta, it's great to drive, but the Ford EcoSport is let down by weaknesses on a number of other counts, namely practicality, economy and cabin quality.;Ford
Ford Tourneo Connect. The Ford Tourneo Connect and larger Grand Tourneo Connect are Ford's attempt at creating a more practical and cheaper alternative to the C-Max and Grand C-Max MPV ranges. Both Tourneo Connects share their DNA with the Transit Connect, but don't let that put you off - in both cases, they're based on the Focus hatchback and Kuga SUV. That means they're surprisingly comfortable by the standards of their rivals. Their boxy shape means that few owners will run out of interior space and there are a pair of cheap-to-run diesel engines available.;Ford
Ford C-MAX. If you need a people carrier but don't want to sacrifice sporty handling, then the Ford C-MAX is a great choice. Accurate steering and a sporty chassis means it's the most entertaining MPV to drive, yet it offers plenty of space for families. The latest model is available as a five seater or in seven-seat Ford Grand C-MAX trim, and the latter also gets sliding rear doors to improve access to the back seats. Soft touch fabrics and a moulded dashboard means interior quality is impressive.;Ford
Ford Ranger. The Ford Ranger is a rugged pick-up. Unlike modern SUVs, like the Kia Sportage or BMW X1, which are biased towards road use, the Ford Ranger gives true off-road ability. It's practical too, thanks to its large truck bed, although the cabin is smaller than you might expect. The Ford Ranger is designed predominantly as a commercial vehicle, so it's tough and should be reliable. However this also means that fewer concessions to comfort have been made, so the Ford Ranger is noisy and can be uncomfortable on longer trips.;Ford
Ford Mondeo. If you think Ford's big-selling family car is a ‘middle of the road’ choice, think again. The Ford Mondeo, facelifted is anything but average. It's spacious and practical, while the suspension and chassis balance comfort and sportiness. There are ten petrol and diesel engines to choose from, and there's a trim level to suit nearly every pocket. Even base model cars are well equipped.;Ford
Ford Kuga. It took Ford a while to enter the compact SUV market with its Ford Kuga, but it was worth the wait. Both four and front-wheel-drive versions are available, and Ford's stylish SUV majors on good looks and driver appeal, but it does so at the expense of some practicality. Its cabin is a snug fit for four adults, and there is only limited storage on offer. It feels like a tall Ford Focus to drive, and is a strong contender in the SUV class. It's not cheap, though, as it's priced to rival Volkswagen's Tiguan.;Ford
Ford S-MAX. The Ford S-MAX is a people carrier that offers masses of space and seven-seat versatility for family buyers. Since the original model went on sale in 2006, the S-MAX has carved out a niche for buyers looking for plenty of space in a car that's great fun to drive. A number of trim levels are available, including the racy Titanium X Sport and there's a range of fuel efficient engines too - although the diesels will remain the most popular.;Ford
Ford Galaxy. Ford's biggest car is also its most luxurious, and a recent facelift has added even more equipment to the seven-seat Ford Galaxy. The full-sized MPV isn’t quite as stylish or dynamic to drive as the Ford S-MAX it shares so much with, but it's more comfortable to ride in. With a massive cabin and boot, it's one of the few cars that really will carry seven adults in comfort. The 2.0 EcoBoost turbo petrol engine is smooth and powerful, but the 2.0 TDCi diesel, available in three power outputs, is more economical. There are three trims: Zetec, Titanium and Titanium X.;Ford
Mazda2. The Mazda2 is a great-looking supermini that's also very good to drive. There's plenty of standard equipment and prices are competitive when measured next to the likes of the Ford Fiesta. Limited supply means resale values are strong, too, so the Mazda is a safe place to invest your cash. Running costs are also low with the 1.3-litre engine.;Mazda
Mazda3. There's a lot to like about the Mazda3. The Japanese family model is available as a hatchback and a saloon, and shares parts with the Ford Focus. Like the Mazda2 it offers sharp looks, excellent build quality, great value for money and economical engines. On the road it feels nimble, and Mazda's focus on reducing the car's weight means it's very responsive. Despite those things it still falls short in a couple of key areas. Rear space isn’t great - which is important for family buyers - and the cabin is awash with confusing buttons and can seem quite dark, and therefore cramped.;Mazda
Mazda6. The Mazda6 is Mazda's largest model, and is a rival for the Volkswagen Passat, Ford Mondeo and Skoda Superb. Top-spec models could even be considered as an alternative to entry-level compact executive cars, such as the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. The Mazda6 is offered with a four-door saloon or five-door Tourer estate body, while power comes from 2.0-litre petrol or 2.2-litre diesel engines – both with a choice of two different power outputs. These engines are relatively large, but Mazda's SKYACTIV technology focuses on weight saving to boost fuel economy. Performance and handling also benefit: the Mazda6 is one of the best handling family cars on sale. Standard equipment is generous and there's plenty of space inside, too.;Mazda
Mazda CX-5. Similar in size to the Land Rover Freelander and Volkswagen Tiguan the Mazda CX-5 is Mazda's entry into the highly competitive crossover or compact SUV market. The CX-5 is great to drive and is available in either two or four wheel drive. Petrol and diesel engines are offered with both manual and automatic gearboxes.;Mazda
Mazda CX-3. The Mazda CX-3 is a small hatchback sized SUV that rivals cars like the Nissan Juke and Skoda Yeti. The stylish CX-3 uses clever technology to deliver low running costs and an entertaining drive. The Mazda CX-3 is about average for interior space for this kind of car, but the quality of the interior really impresses. There's a range of petrol and diesel engines which offer a good blend of performance and economy.;Mazda
Mazda MX-5. The Mazda MX-5 is the world's best-selling roadster, and has been offering value-packed, entertaining driving since it was first launched in 1989. There are 1.8-litre or 2.0-litre engines to choose from, and you can opt for a canvas roof, or a folding hard top – which offers better protection from the elements. Both engines need to be worked hard to extract their performance, but that's part of the fun. The five and six-speed manual gearboxes are very precise. Handling is superb, making the car exciting to drive. The Mazda MX-5 is a strict two-seater, but has a good-sized boot. Equipment levels are OK on the entry-level cars, but you pay extra for air-conditioning. The 2.0-litre car is very well equipped.;Mazda
